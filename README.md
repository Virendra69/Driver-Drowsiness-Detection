# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Wrote the Driver Drowsiness Detection program using Python, Tensorflow, OpenCV

* First ipynb file (CUSTOM MODEL) contains the main model custom trained on a set of drowsy and non-drowsy photos
* Second ipynb file (Using CUSTOM MODEL) contains the implementation of the custom trained model using OpenCV

During the implementation, OpenCV's VideoCpature is used to realtime detect the drowsiness and display it on the screen
